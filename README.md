## Getting Started

- to run manually 
- change `const apiEndpoint= process.env.PUBLIC_URL` to `const apiEndpoint = "http://localhost:8080"`
- follow bash files runViaTomcat.sh or runViaSpringYarn.sh or win_runViaSpringYarn.ps1

### Run on Tomcat Server

- edit as needed and run bash script runViaTomcat.sh, takes ~ 30min

### Run with Spring boot and npm/yarn

-- change `const apiEndpoint= process.env.PUBLIC_URL` to `const apiEndpoint = "http://localhost:8080"`
-- edit as needed and run bash script runViaSpringYarn.sh, takes ~ 10min

## Deployment

To make a war file for deployment:
- run `yarn build` while in the project folder `.../Projektas_Darzeliu_IS/front`
- move all files from folder `.../Projektas_Darzeliu_IS/front/build`
to `.../back/source/main/resources/public`
- run `mvn clean install` while in the project folder `.../Projektas_Darzeliu_IS/back`
- `darzelis.war` file will appear in the `..\Projektas_Darzeliu_IS\back\target` folder

or use win_runViaSpringYarn.ps1 script on windows

### Accessing the database

http://localhost:8081/darzelis/console

```
JDBC URL:jdbc:h2:~/tmp/neverLatte1.db
User Name:sa

```

### Accessing API documentation

http://localhost:8081/darzelis/swagger-ui/


## Running the tests

- for smoke tests, run smoke.xml
- for regression tests, run regression.xml

### Break down into end to end tests

There are 7 different test packages: adminTests, specialistTests, parentTests, login, smokeTests, generalMethods and basetest. First 3 are the main ones, generalMethods holds reusable code for different test cases and basetest is for set up (getting Chrome driver and application link) and closing all tests after running them.

```
adminTests package tests:
- create and delete new user (all three roles)
- update admin details (change user information, password, reset password)

specialistTests package tests:
- create and delete new kindergarten
- update specialist details (change user information, password, reset password)

parentPages package tests:
- submit and delete new application
- update parent details (change user information, password, reset password)
- upload medical document (pdf)

```
